For ESP-Hosted-FG, we are discontinuing Linux subsystem as we have [esp-hosted-ng](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted/tree/master/esp_hosted_ng) [latest release](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted/releases) as better replacement available.
In case, you want to use FG variant for Linux only, please refer to release [ESP-Hosted-FG 0.0.5](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted/releases/tag/release%2Ffg-v0.0.5).
